            <p>Over the years the internet has given a lot to me. I have learned much from the internets and have had many lolz along the way.</p>
            <p>This is my attempt to give back and pass on some of what I have learned. Topics will range from Ruby to rants and include every geeky thing that pops into my head. Although my head can be a scary place I will try to keep things civil. :)</p>

              <h3>Complete Me! The relationship formula.</h3>
              
              <p>Who are seeing these days? No one? Oh, it's ok. You will find someone. Eventually ...</p>
              
              <p>Yeah. We have all had that conversation with someone. Movies, music, friends, relatives ... they all tell us the same thing. You just aren't complete without your other half. A single person is just someone who hasn't found someone yet. Lets put this into a simple formula to try and make sense of things.</p>
              
              <div class="CodeRay">
                <div class="code"><pre>&#x000A;    me = half&#x000A;    you = half&#x000A;    you + me = <span class="i">1</span> complete relationship&#x000A;    </pre></div>
              </div>
              
              
              <p>Of course! That is it. You can see this formula everywhere you see a relationship. In order to be complete we need to find our matching half. The other person to complete us.</p>
              
              <h3>It just doesn't add up.</h3>
              
              <p>But wait. I know some single people who seem pretty complete. They are successful, happy and just all round good people. What about them? Are they not whole? Maybe they just don't know what they are missing. Or maybe they would be even more (insert good thing here) if they had there match. Maybe.</p>
              
              <p>Hey. I also know some people in relationships. You know complete people. Completely messed up. In fact I think I know of more bad relationships where both parties are worse off than I know good ones. Maybe they just aren't with the right person. Yeah. Thats it. It isn't there fault they have one bad relationship after another. They just need to keep searching for Mr/Mrs Right. Because there is someone out there who was meant for them. The ONE that will complete them. Maybe.</p>
              
              <p>I mean this is conventional wisdom. It is everywhere in our culture. It has to be true. From fairy tales to Shakespeare the love formula is always the same. Half a person + Half a person = A whole relationship. Simple. Maybe.</p>
              
              <h3>Lets Multiply!</h3>
              
              <p>The sign is just wrong. No not the zodiac sign of the other person. The sign in the formula. It should be * not +. Yep. We should be multiplying not adding.</p>
              
              <p><em>So I am not half a person?</em></p>
              
              <p>Nope. Well you don't have to be anyway. Everyone is at different places so lets give a range of 0 - 2 to define a person. This value represents how complete they are. One being a completely balanced self sufficient person. One plus means you are not only capable of fulfilling all your needs but have some to give back as well. And the ... lets call the incomplete ... less than ones are anyone who has a need that they look to others to fulfill.</p>
              
              <p>Now it is important to keep in mind that this value isn't set. And it doesn't come from outside. It is how you view yourself. This can and will change constantly.</p>
              
              <p>So what does our new formula show us? Well lets look at a couple examples of ... um ... couples.</p>
              
              <p>First we have two whole people. They are both ones. Complete and competent.</p>
              
              <div class="CodeRay">
                <div class="code"><pre>&#x000A;    you = <span class="i">1</span> person&#x000A;    me = <span class="i">1</span> person&#x000A;    you * me = <span class="i">1</span> relationship&#x000A;    </pre></div>
              </div>
              
              
              <p>Well that is nice. A complete healthy relationship. But it took two complete people to make that complete relationship. Hmmmmmm. What happens when one of the people is half a person like in the standard formula?</p>
              
              <div class="CodeRay">
                <div class="code"><pre>&#x000A;    you = <span class="i">1</span> person&#x000A;    me = .<span class="i">5</span> person&#x000A;    you * me = .<span class="i">5</span> relationship&#x000A;    </pre></div>
              </div>
              
              
              <p>Oh! Thats not good at all. Our relationship is wanting. I just brought you down. Together we are less than when we started. that kinda makes me sad :(</p>
              
              <p>What happens if we are both incomplete and looking for someone to complete us?</p>
              
              <div class="CodeRay">
                <div class="code"><pre>&#x000A;    you = .<span class="i">5</span> person&#x000A;    me = .<span class="i">5</span> person&#x000A;    you * me = .<span class="i">25</span> relationship&#x000A;    </pre></div>
              </div>
              
              
              <p>Well Crap! This is just getting worse. You have two incomplete people they don't make a complete relationship! They make a super bad sad relationship. The kind you don't like to hear about but do way to often.</p>
              
              <p>Can there be the idolized great relationship where everyone comes out better because of it? Well lets look at what happens when you have two one plusses.</p>
              
              <div class="CodeRay">
                <div class="code"><pre>&#x000A;    you = <span class="fl">1.5</span> person&#x000A;    me = <span class="fl">1.5</span> person&#x000A;    you * me = <span class="fl">2.25</span> relationship&#x000A;    </pre></div>
              </div>
              
              
              <p>Now that I like. We are both better off. We complement each other instead of completing. And that is key. We have to be one plus to have anything to add to a relationship. If we are incomplete we drag the other person down.</p>
              
              <h3>How does this help me?</h3>
              
              <p>Well everyone wants to be complete and happy. So how can we be complete? There is only one way to be complete. Complete yourself. You cannot have a complete, positive, upbuilding relationship if you are not complete yourself.</p>
              
              <p><em>But that means I am responsible for my relationships :(</em></p>
              
              <p>Yes! It is up to you how you and your relationship work. Now it can happen that a one plus finds a incomplete. It happens often actually. There is cultural pressure on anyone who is complete to go and complete someone else. But a complete person can choose. They can be complete without someone. And they can wait until they find someone else who is complete ... or not. That is the point. If you are complete you don't need someone else. You are good already.</p>
              
              <p><em>That means I am responsible for my happiness!</em></p>
              
              <p>It is empowering isn't it! You don't need to be completed. You only need you. It is ok to be single. It is even better than being in a bad relationship where both people suffer. And if you are a one plus and eventually do find another one plus then you will end up with a relationship that is the way relationships should be. An upbuilding positive experience.</p>
              
              <h3>In the wild.</h3>
              
              <p>I have several stories of good relationships, bad relationships and happy single people that I will share when I get the permission of the people involved. Until then I would love to hear stories and examples of the new relationship formula in action. Please use the comments to let us hear your story.</p>
