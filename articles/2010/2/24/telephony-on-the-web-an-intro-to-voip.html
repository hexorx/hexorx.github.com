            <p>Over the years the internet has given a lot to me. I have learned much from the internets and have had many lolz along the way.</p>
            <p>This is my attempt to give back and pass on some of what I have learned. Topics will range from Ruby to rants and include every geeky thing that pops into my head. Although my head can be a scary place I will try to keep things civil. :)</p>

              <p>Telephony is awesome. Why is it awesome? The telephone system is something that has been around longer than all/most of us have been alive. It has been 95 years since the first US coast-to-coast call was made in 1915. Yet right now the technology behind telephony is going through a major paradigm shift that puts developers in control.</p>
              
              <p>Telephones are moving from giant switches that filled entire buildings to data networks and soft-switches. The important thing about this change is that when a call becomes data it is just another piece of software. Soft-switches make it telephony accessible to anyone who has a desire to tinker.</p>
              
              <p>We are going to start off with some terminology, a crash course in the basics of telephony and what kind of setup is needed to start playing. Next we will go into a couple different ways web technologies can be used to take control of a telephone system.</p>
              
              <h3>A SIP of what?</h3>
              
              <p>The common term for making calls over a data network is Voice over IP or VoIP. VoIP is made possible by SIP. SIP is a protocol like HTTP and is in fact based on HTTP. So you have very familiar messages like 200 OK and 404 Not Found. It also uses an address format we will all recognize. For example if Joe has a phone registered to <a href="http://teliax.com">Teliax</a> his address would be joe@teliax.com. I will go into more details on phones and registrations in a second. The point is the address is exactly the same as an email address. It contains a user followed by an @ and ends with the domain.</p>
              
              <p>To make or receive calls you need an end-point. An end point can be a SIP phone, VoIP adapter or soft-phone. Put simply an end-point is a network client that speaks the SIP protocol. To be useful these end-points register to a switch and tell the switch where they are located. This allows other people to send calls to the switch and the switch deal with trying to find the right end-point. The switch is also where we can do all the fun stuff. Before we go into detail on a switch lets go over some of the end-point options.</p>
              
              <h4>SIP Phone</h4>
              
              <p>A SIP phone looks just like a regular phone but it plugs into a data network instead of a normal phone network. It acts as any other client on the network, with its own ip address and everything. Sip phones start at under $100 for a basic <a href="http://www.8774e4voip.com/Aastra_6730i_p/aastra-6730i.htm">Aastra 6730i</a> to over $400 for an awesome multi-line touch-screen <a href="http://www.8774e4voip.com/Aastra_6739i_p/aastra-6739i.htm">Aastra 6739i</a>. And yes I like and recommend both Aastra and <a href="http://www.8774e4voip.com/">e4voip</a>.</p>
              
              <h4>VoIP Adapter</h4>
              
              <p>This is the type of thing you would get from Vonage. It just turns a regular phone into a SIP Phone. It has a phone jack, or two, a network jack and a power cord. Pretty simple little devices. The usually start at $50 for a two line ATA. There are some really fancy ones that have anywhere from 8 to 24 and more lines.</p>
              
              <p>A VoIP adapter is a good option if you have a lot of legacy phones that you want to keep around or are plugging a legacy telephone system into new cool VoIP stuff.</p>
              
              <p>When looking for a VoIP adapter you want to make sure not to use one from Vonage or some other VoIP provider that locks their equipment. You can only use them with that provider. It is best to buy them somewhere like <a href="http://www.8774e4voip.com/">e4voip</a> where you know they will come unlocked.</p>
              
              <h4>Soft-Phone</h4>
              
              <p>A soft-phone is just a piece of software you run on your computer. They are the easiest and cheapest way to get started but don't always give you the same quality or nice feel of a real phone. Soft-phones are available for every major OS and most smart phones. On OS X I like to use the open source <a href="http://code.google.com/p/telephone/">Telephone</a>. <a href="http://www.sjlabs.com/sjp.html">SJPhone</a> is available on OS X, Linux and Windows but isn't as nice.</p>
              
              <h3>Switch it up!</h3>
              
              <p>The switch is responsible for routing calls from one person to another and inserting all sorts of fun things in the middle. This is where we can plug in to control where a call goes or make an interactive system with prompts and live data and other coolness.</p>
              
              <p>In the next couple articles I will go into the different ways we can plug into these switches and make them do what we want using XML and our favorite tools for generating said XML.</p>
