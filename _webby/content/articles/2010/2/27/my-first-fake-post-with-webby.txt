I am moving from SquareSpace to webby. SquareSpace had its good points but it just didn't give me the control I wanted. I will cover the good and bad of both SquareSpace and webby in a future post. For now I am going to use this post to play and get formatting right.

I would like to be able to syntax highlight code like so:

    ruby!
    def foo
      'bar'
    end
    
This should be json though

    json!
    { "just": "an", "example": 42 }

That should be pretty.

I found out something new about github pages. You only get custom domain support on a paid account. They start at $7/mo which is nothing for a service I use daily. So I guess it is time to upgrade.
