I always feel like I am filling something out for a personal ad when writing one of these things. Always have to try and sell yourself.
  
A summary of who I am? My history? A short autobiography? It would start with me being born in a small town in western Iowa on the same day the first IBM [PC][] went on sell. Could be a sign. Or just random chance.
  
Growing up I had the same story as many geeks who grew up during that time. Found a used Commodore 64 at a garage sale and learned the basics of programming to get it to do anything. Later hacked around on the phone lines in the house in order to get access to a local BBS in my bedroom. And later, the internets, when they finally made it to my small town.
  
After high school I got a job at the local telephone company writing database apps for use in there accounting department. I moved to Denver, CO in 2003 looking to mix things up a bit. Worked in a coffee shop and a family business while keeping up on tech and programming on my own.

In 2006, while looking for a VoIP provider, I stumbled across the Denver based [Teliax][]. When I called in to there sales line to get extra info it came up that they were hiring. And I have been working for them ever since.

I have decided that after years of lurking on the web I should start giving back. To that end I have written several ruby gems while working at [Teliax][] and am now starting a blog. While I am going to keep it mostly to tech, programming and telephony I will throw in some other random personal rants.

Although I work for [Teliax][] and they will be mentioned often this is my personal blog. Meaning the standard ... blah blah ... do not reflect the thoughts or opinions of Teliax ... blah blah ... legal ... etc.
